## Description of the task
Transformation of multiple vertices (maximum 5). The program should ask for user input and transform the polygon accordingly.

### My approach
I have decided to handle user input with GLFW for convenience. My polygon consist of 5 vertices, I divided it into 3 triangles. 

### Results
